# Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification-OO

The original project is [Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification) by [Spacerat](https://github.com/sp4cerat).
It is Procedure-Oriented programmed with C/C++.

For some kinds of use, I re-write [Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification) with OO programming in C++.
The main function of [Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification) is not changed.
